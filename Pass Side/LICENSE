Preamble

The GNU General Public License is a free, copyleft license for
software and other kinds of works.

The licenses for most software and other practical works are designed
to take away your freedom to share and change the works. By contrast,
the GNU General Public License is intended to guarantee your freedom
to share and change all versions of a program—to make sure it remains
free software for all its users. We, the Free Software Foundation,
use the GNU General Public License for most of our software; it applies
also to any other work released this way by its authors. You can apply
it to your programs, too.
